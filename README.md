## The Credit Card Payment Default Prediction project is a data-driven solution that aims to predict whether a credit cardholder is likely to default on their payment.
## By analyzing various factors such as the customer's demographic information, credit history, payment patterns, and financial behavior, the project uses machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
## These models can assess the creditworthiness of individuals and assign a probability of defaulting on future payments. By identifying high-risk customers, financial institutions can take proactive measures to mitigate potential losses and make informed decisions regarding credit approvals, credit limits, and collection strategies.
## Ultimately, the project helps improve risk management and decision-making processes in the credit card industry.
